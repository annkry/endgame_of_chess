# endgame_of_chess
The task at hand is to create a program that will analyze the endgame of chess, where one side (black) only has a king and the other side has a king and a rook. The program should determine the minimum number of moves needed to achieve checkmate for white, assuming that the black king cooperates with the white pieces. The program will read the situation on the board from a text file (zad1_input.txt), which contains information about the player who has the move, the positions of the white king, white rook, and black king. The program should work in two modes: batch mode, where it reads multiple situations from the input file and writes the results to an output file (zad1_output.txt), and debug mode, where the user can view the moves leading to checkmate (via print statements). If one of the players is unable to make a move and their king is not in check, it is considered a stalemate (in chess terms), which is a draw in regular chess but in this cooperative variant it is a valid final state. If there is no way to avoid a stalemate, the program should output "INF".

To run all tests (command): python validator.py zad1 python main.py
